# CaptureTheFlag
Repository that contains all of my solutions to **Capture The Flag** competitions that I have attended.

## Files structure
In each subdirectory corresponding to a specific challenge, you might be able to find the following files:
- `container` subdirectory - files that I was able to export/download out of the container that was provided to me during the challenge (so you can have a better idea of what I was working with)
- `task.md` - a description of the task that I was supposed to solve
- `solution.md` - a detailed explanation of the solution that I have come up with
- other files that I have created/used during the challenge (their purpose is usually explained somewhere inside the particular task)

### EE_CTF 2024
CTF organised by Electrical Faculty at WUT mostly for Applied Computer Science students during summer holidays. I managed to complete 6 out of 9 tasks.

### PW_CTF_DS 2024-2025
CTF organised as a part of "Data Security" course in the field of Applied Computer Science at WUT. While this challenge wasn't obligatory for all of us to actually participate, it provided juicy additional points, and I was totally down for it. I have completed all 5 out of 5 tasks (excluding the test one as that wasn't really a challenge for anyone).
