# CaptureTheFlag
Repository that contains all of my solutions to **Capture The Flag** competitions that I have attended.

### EE_CTF 2024
CTF organised by Electrical Faculty at WUT mostly for Applied Computer Science students during summer holidays. I managed to complete 6 out of 9 tasks.

### PW_CTF_DS 2024-2025
CTF organised as a part of "Data Security" course in the field of Applied Computer Science at WUT. While this challenge wasn't obligatory for all of us, it provided juicy additional points, and I was totally down for it. I have completed 4 out of 4 tasks (excluding the test one as that wasn't really a challenge for anyone).
