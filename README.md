# CaptureTheFlag

Repository that contains all of my solutions to **Capture The Flag** competitions that I have attended.

### EE_CTF_2024
CTF organised by Electrical Faculty at WUT mostly for Applied Computer Science students. I managed to complete 6 out of 9 tasks.

### EE_CTF_DS_2024_2025
CTF organised as a part of "Data Security" course in the field of Applied Computer Science at WUT. While this course wasn't obligatory for all of us, it provided juicy additional points and I was totally down for it. I have completed 1 out of 1 tasks.
